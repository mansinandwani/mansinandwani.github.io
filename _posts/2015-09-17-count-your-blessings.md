They say visiting hospitals is very disturbing. But today, a visit to the IRCH showed me a new light to view my life in.
For those of you fortunate ones who are not well versed with the term, IRCH stands for Institute Rotary Cancer Hospital,
the cancer division of AIIMS, New Delhi. Cancer, a disease we all are too familiar with and a name we hear almost every
day continues to be a much dreaded disease even after the tremendous advancement medical science has made. Today I saw why.

It is truly heartbreaking to witness countless breathing examples of such sorrowful existence confined within those four
walls. Depressed parents trying to cheer their ailing kids, young men supporting lifeless limbs, newlywed wives supporting
their impaired husbands, old men pushing around their frail wives in wheelchairs; the stories are endless.
It is hard at times to tell a patient from their relatives because the look of helplessness on every face is the same.
At the same time, some patients exhibit such extraordinary strength that it fills you with admiration.

Much to my surprise, these scenes of absolute misery taught me a very important lesson of life.
There were people who have been staying on the streets for weeks because the queues are long,
the treatment is a necessity and they simply do not have anywhere else to go. It made me realize just one thing:
how much we really have and how less of it we are actually thankful for.

Seeing little kids put up a brave face as nurses pricked their timid wrists put all my meaningless complaints about life
and work to shame. Even going to sleep every night with a healthy body and mind in a safe surrounding is a luxury some
people donâ€™t have. While we bicker about hypocrite friends, meager pays, inconsiderate bosses, some fight for mere
existence and a decent living every single day.

Be thankful because you woke up healthy this morning. Be thankful because you have a comfortable bed to sleep in tonight.
Be thankful for the light in your eyes and the beat of your heart. Be thankful because you are not sleeping on an empty
stomach. Be thankful because there are four walls that will keep you safe. Be thankful if you can speak, read and write.
Be thankful if you can buy and wear that beautiful dress. Be thankful because you have someone to talk to when in distress.
Be thankful because you are loved and cared for.
